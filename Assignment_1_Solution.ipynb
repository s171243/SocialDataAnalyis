Hint for comment: Some things make sense - for example `drunkenness` and the weekend. But there are some aspects that were surprising to me. Check out `prostitution` and mid-week behavior, for example!?\n",
    "* *The months*. We can also check if some months are worse by counting up number of crimes in Jan, Feb, ..., Dec. Did you see any surprises there?\n",
    "* *The 23 hour cycle*. We'll can also forget about weekday and simply count up the number of each crime-type that occurs in the entire dataset from midnight to 1am, 1am - 2am ... and so on. Again: Give me a couple of comments on what you see. \n",
    "* *Hours of the week*. But by looking at just 23 hours, we may be missing some important trends that can be modulated by week-day, so let's also check out the 168 hours of the week. So let's see the number of each crime-type Monday night from midninght to 1am, Monday night from 1am-2am - all the way to Sunday night from 11pm to midnight.\n",

My hunch from inspecting the file is that the police-folks might be a little bit lazy in noting down the **exact** time down to the second. So choose a crime-type and a suitable time interval (somewhere between a month and 6 months depending on the crime-type) and create a jitter plot of the arrest times during a single hour (like 13-14, for example). So let time run on the $x$-axis and create vertical jitter."

    "2. When we investigated the details of how the timestamps are recorded using jitter-plots, we saw that many more crimes were recorded e.g. on the hour, 15 minutes past the hour, and to a lesser in whole increments of 10 minutes. Crimes didn't appear to be recorded as frequently in between those round numbers. Remind yourself [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2021/master/files/jitter_plot.png), where I've highlighted the phenomenon I'm talking about.\n",
    "3. And finally, today we saw that the Hall of Justice seemed to be an unlikely hotspot for sex offences. Remind yourself [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2021/master/files/crime_hot_spot.png).\n",
